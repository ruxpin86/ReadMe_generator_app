## Challenge 9: Read Me Generator App

## Description

For this project we were tasked with utilizing node.js and the inquirer package to develop a command line app that by using a series of user prompts generates a properly formatted README. Along with ability to have a README generated in a seperate file we were also required to make our own video demo of how to properly execute our application.

## Challenges

For this project there were a couple portions that were a bit challenging, specifically getting a grasp of licenses and badges. We had not really covered this in lecture and I was unsure of what they were and how they were implemented in an actual real world application. Another portion that was a bit ambiguous was learning proper markdown syntax, which I never realized there was before. In previous challenges I had simply been typing out a README not realizing there was a way make it look more professional with proper formatting syntax. Glad I finally learned this so that I am no longer being docked points for it in future graded assignments.

## What I Learned

How to finally make a readMe the way that is expected and so I don't get docked points any more, and also how to use .gitignore so that I no longer lose points for the DS_store files that have been taking up space in my repositories. I was also glad to learn how to create a useful back end application that will save quite a bit of time in the future when I have to make a README for challenges.
